Main driver is menu.java
Calls main and menu.

Had no issues when running. Code did not crash.

Code can be located in SurveyGenerator/src.
Surveys can be located in SurveyGenerator/serialSave/Surveys
Completed surveys can be located in SurveyGenerator/serialSave/Completed

Also moved some of the classes from the student repository into src
Such as SerializationHelper, Validation, Input, FSConfig and FileUtils

Code is commented and neatly arranged
Should be easy to understand and follow

Only issue I would point out is that user has to re-enter the name of the survey they are loading.
Besides that, a flawless user experience.
